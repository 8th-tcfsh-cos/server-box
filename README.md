# Server Box

The official web server repo for the TCFSH COS box.

## What's This?

This repo contains files of the TCFSH COS box, and can(and should) be run on a web server like [nginx](nginx.org), unlike the older version which is served on Github Pages.

## About The Box

It was given the name when the only purpose of this website was to serve as a submission form, which should(but didn't) have a physical "box" version. As of today, more and more functions are added to the box, making it a multi-functional website.
